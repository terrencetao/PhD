    "Many applications such as social recommendation, item recommendation,\n",
    "knowledge graph completion, etc., can be formulated as link prediction,\n",
    "which predicts whether an edge exists between two particular nodes. This\n",
    "tutorial shows an example of predicting whether a citation relationship,\n",
    "either citing or being cited, between two papers exists in a citation\n",
    "network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial formulates the link prediction problem as a binary classification\n",
    "problem as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Treat the edges in the graph as *positive examples*.\n",
    "-  Sample a number of non-existent edges (i.e. node pairs with no edges\n",
    "   between them) as *negative* examples.\n",
    "-  Divide the positive examples and negative examples into a training\n",
    "   set and a test set.\n",
    "-  Evaluate the model with any binary classification metric such as Area\n",
    "   Under Curve (AUC).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>The practice comes from\n",

    "   although the model here does not use their idea of node labeling.</p></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In some domains such as large-scale recommender systems or information\n",
