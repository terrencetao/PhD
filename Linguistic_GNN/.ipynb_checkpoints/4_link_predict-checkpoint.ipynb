       "'April is the fourth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars, and comes between March and May. It is one of four months to have 30 days.\\n\\nApril always begins on the same day of week as July, and additionally, January in leap years. April always ends on the same day of the week as December.\\n\\nApril\\'s flowers are the Sweet Pea and Daisy. Its birthstone is the diamond. The meaning of the diamond is innocence.\\n\\nThe Month \\n\\nApril comes between March and May, making it the fourth month of the year. It also comes first in the year out of the four months that have 30 days, as June, September and November are later in the year.\\n\\nApril begins on the same day of the week as July every year and on the same day of the week as January in leap years. April ends on the same day of the week as December every year, as each other\\'s last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart.\\n\\nIn common years, April starts on the same day of the week as October of the previous year, and in leap years, May of the previous year. In common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as July of the previous year, and in leap years, February and October of the previous year. In common years immediately after other common years, April starts on the same day of the week as January of the previous year, and in leap years and years immediately after that, April finishes on the same day of the week as January of the previous year.\\n\\nIn years immediately before common years, April starts on the same day of the week as September and December of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, June of the following year. In years immediately before common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as September of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, March and June of the following year.\\n\\nApril is a spring month in the Northern Hemisphere and an autumn/fall month in the Southern Hemisphere. In each hemisphere, it is the seasonal equivalent of October in the other.\\n\\nIt is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the Latin word \"aperire\", meaning \"to open\", referring to flowers opening in spring. Another theory is that the name could come from Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. It was originally the second month in the old Roman Calendar, before the start of the new year was put to January 1.\\n\\nQuite a few festivals are held in this month. In many Southeast Asian cultures, new year is celebrated in this month (including Songkran). In Western Christianity, Easter can be celebrated on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25. In Orthodox Christianity, it can fall between April 4 and May 8. At the end of the month, Central and Northern European cultures celebrate Walpurgis Night on April 30, marking the transition from winter into summer.\\n\\nApril in poetry \\nPoets use April to mean the end of winter. For example: April showers bring May flowers.\\n\\nEvents in April\\n\\nFixed Events \\n\\n April 1 - April Fools\\' Day\\n April 1 - Islamic Republic Day (Iran)\\n April 2 - International Children\\'s Book Day\\n April 2 - Thai Heritage and Conservation Day\\n April 2 - World Autism Awareness Day\\n April 2 - Malvinas Day (Argentina)\\n April 4 - Independence Day (Senegal)\\n April 4 - International Day for Landmine Awareness and Assistance\\n April 4 - Peace Day (Angola)\\n April 5 - End of Tax Year (United Kingdom)\\n April 6 - Tartan Day (Canada and United States)\\n April 6 - Chakri Day (Thailand)\\n April 7 - Day of Maternity and Beauty (Armenia)\\n April 7 - Genocide Memorial Day (Rwanda)\\n April 7 - World Health Day\\n April 7 - Women\\'s Day (Mozambique)\\n April 8 - Buddha\\'s Birthday (Buddhism)\\n April 9 - Martyrs\\' Day (Tunisia)\\n April 9 - Day of National Unity (Georgia)\\n April 9 - Day of the Finnish language\\n April 12 - Cosmonauts\\' Day (Russia), marking the day of Yuri Gagarin\\'s space flight\\n April 13 - Songkan (Laos), local New Year celebration\\n April 13 - Cambodian New Year\\n April 13 - Thomas Jefferson\\'s Birthday (United States)\\n April 14 - Southeast Asian New Year festivals, including Songkran\\n April 14 - Georgian language Day\\n April 14 - Youth Day (Angola)\\n April 14 - Ambedkar Tayanti (India)\\n April 14 - Pan-American Day\\n April 15 - Tax Day (United States)\\n April 15 - Kim Il-Sung\\'s Birthday (North Korea)\\n April 15 - Father Damien Day (Hawaii)\\n April 15 - Jackie Robinson Day (Major League Baseball)\\n April 16 - Birthday of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark\\n April 16 - Emancipation Day (Washington, DC)\\n April 16 - World Voice Day\\n April 16 - Selena Day (Texas)\\n April 17 - National Day of Syria\\n April 17 - Flag Day (American Samoa)\\n April 17 - Women\\'s Day (Gabon)\\n April 17 - World Hemophilia Day\\n April 18 - Independence Day (Zimbabwe)\\n April 18 - Invention Day (Japan)\\n April 18 - International Day of Monuments and Sites\\n April 19 - Bicycle Day\\n April 19 - Dutch-American Friendship Day\\n April 19 - Birthday of King Mswati III of Swaziland\\n April 19 - Patriots\\' Day (Massachusetts, Maine, Wisconsin)\\n April 20 - 4/20 in Cannabis Culture\\n April 21 - John Muir Day (California)\\n April 21 - San Jacinto Day (Texas)\\n April 21 - Kartini Day (Indonesia)\\n April 21 - National Tree Planting Day (Kenya)\\n April 21 - First Day of Ridran (Baha\\'i faith)\\n April 21 - Grounation Day (Rastafari movement)\\n April 22 - Earth Day\\n April 22 - Discovery Day (Brazil)\\n April 23 - Saint George\\'s Day, celebrating the patron saint of several countries, regions and cities (including England and Catalonia)\\n April 23 - World Book Day\\n April 23 - National Sovereignty and Children\\'s Day (Turkey)\\n April 24 - Democracy Day (Nepal)\\n April 24 - Genocide Day (Armenia)\\n April 24 - Republic Day (the Gambia)\\n April 25 - Australia and New Zealand celebrate ANZAC Day.
